# hello-world

My name is Logan, you can call me Jon, and this is my "Hello World!" package on GitHub.
It's a pretty small package, but thankfully, GitHub is a place where small and efficient are
the order of the day!

This is just a test project to play around with GitHub, repositories, workflow and node.js itself.

I still need to sleep, though.

Badly.
